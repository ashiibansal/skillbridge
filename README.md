## SkillBridge – A Skill Gap Analysis and Learning Resource Recommendation Platform for Students

SkillBridge is a web-based platform designed to help students identify gaps between their current skill sets and the skills required for their target career roles. The system analyzes user-provided skill data, highlights missing or weak skills, and recommends relevant learning resources to support informed, self-paced career preparation.

This project is developed using **Agile (Scrum) methodology** as part of an academic coursework, with iterative development across multiple sprints.
